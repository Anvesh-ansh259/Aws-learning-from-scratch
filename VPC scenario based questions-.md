1\) **You have a private subnet with no internet access, but your instances need to download updates. How do you enable this securely?**



If I have instances in a private subnet with no direct internet access but they still need to download updates, the best practice is to use a NAT Gateway in a public subnet. The private subnet’s route table would point outbound traffic (like 0.0.0.0/0) to that NAT Gateway. This allows the instances to initiate outbound connections securely, while still preventing any inbound internet traffic.



For additional security, I’d use VPC endpoints for services like S3 or DynamoDB so traffic stays on the AWS network instead of the internet. In highly restricted environments, I’d even maintain a private package repository or mirror updates internally. But the standard approach is: Private subnet → NAT Gateway → Internet.

2\) 2) **your application in one vps needs to communicate with a database in another vpc, how would u set up this ?**

Ans->

Step 2 – Possible Solutions



**VPC Peering (most common/simple)**



Create a VPC peering connection between the two VPCs.



Update route tables to send traffic between them.



Allow DB port (e.g., 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for Postgres) in the DB’s security group.



Limitation: Peering is non-transitive (can’t route traffic via a third VPC).



**Transit Gateway (for large-scale / multi-VPC setup)**



Use AWS Transit Gateway to connect multiple VPCs centrally.



Scales better than multiple peering connections.



Allows centralized control and routing.



**PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Service) (more secure, service-based access)**



Expose the database as a VPC Endpoint Service in the DB’s VPC.



The application’s VPC connects via Interface Endpoint.



This keeps traffic within AWS backbone, doesn’t need full VPC peering.



Very secure and controlled access (good for cross-account).

3\) 3) **You have created a new ec2 instances in a public subnet bt it cannot access the internet. what might be mis configured ?**



Public Subnet Internet Access Checklist



For an EC2 in a public subnet to access the internet, you need:



**Internet Gateway (IGW) attached to the VPC**



Without an IGW, no outbound internet access.



**Route table for the subnet**



Must have a default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the IGW.



Public IP / Elastic IP on the EC2



Instances in a public subnet must have a public IPv4 address (or Elastic IP).



If “Auto-assign Public IP” was disabled at launch, it won’t work.



Security Groups



Must allow outbound traffic (by default, SGs allow all outbound, but if restricted, it can block internet).



Network ACLs



Must allow outbound and inbound responses (e.g., allow ephemeral ports 1024–65535).



✅ Sample Interview Answer:



"If my EC2 is in a public subnet but can’t access the internet, the misconfiguration is usually one of three things: the subnet route table doesn’t point to the Internet Gateway, the instance doesn’t have a public or Elastic IP assigned, or the VPC has no Internet Gateway attached. Less commonly, restrictive security group or NACL rules can also block access.

4\) **You need to connect your on-premises data center to AWS securely. Which VPC feature would you use?**



The secure options are:



AWS Site-to-Site VPN – Encrypted IPsec VPN tunnel over the internet from your on-premises data center to your VPC. Quick to set up, fully managed, secure, but latency depends on the internet.



AWS Direct Connect – Dedicated private network link between on-premises and AWS. More consistent performance, higher bandwidth, but requires physical setup.



Direct Connect + VPN (hybrid) – Use Direct Connect for performance, and a VPN as failover for security and redundancy.



Sample Interview Answer:

"To securely connect an on-premises data center to a VPC, I’d use Site-to-Site VPN for encrypted connectivity, or AWS Direct Connect if low latency and consistent bandwidth are required. In many production cases, companies use both together—Direct Connect for performance and a VPN as backup—to ensure secure, reliable connectivity.

**5) How do you restrict access to an EC2 instance so that only a specific IP range can connect?**



To restrict access to an EC2 instance so that only a specific IP range can connect, I would configure the instance’s security group to allow inbound traffic only from that IP range. For example, if I want SSH access from my office network, I’d add an inbound rule on port 22 with the office CIDR block. Optionally, I can add a subnet-level Network ACL as another layer of restriction. This ensures no other IPs can connect.



=================================================================================================================================================================================

6\) **Your team wants to host multiple environments (dev,test, prod) in a single AWs account, how would you design the Vpcs?**



I would design separate VPCs for Dev, Test, and Prod, each with its own CIDR range and isolated networking. Inside each VPC, I’d create public and private subnets across multiple AZs, with NAT gateways and IGWs where needed. This ensures strong isolation so that Prod is not affected by Dev or Test. For any shared services, I could use a separate Shared Services VPC and connect via Transit Gateway or VPC Peering. I’d also enforce isolation through IAM, security groups, and tagging.



=================================================================================================================================================================================

7\) **How would you allow private subnets to access the internet without exposing them directly?**



I would place a NAT Gateway in a public subnet and update the private subnet’s route table so that outbound internet traffic goes through the NAT Gateway. This way, instances in the private subnet can access the internet for updates or API calls, but they are not directly reachable from the internet. For AWS services like S3 or DynamoDB, I’d use VPC endpoints instead, which keeps traffic inside AWS and avoids the internet entirely.



=================================================================================================================================================================================

8\) **Your application requires low latency and high throughput between two VPCs across different AWS accounts. What’s the best solution?**



The best solution is to use VPC Peering. It provides a direct, private connection between the two VPCs, even across AWS accounts, and leverages AWS’s backbone network for low latency and high throughput. If the architecture required many VPCs interconnected, I’d consider AWS Transit Gateway, but for two VPCs, peering is the optimal choice.



=================================================================================================================================================================================

9\) **You deployed a NAT Gateway but still can’t reach the internet from private subnets. What could be wrong?**



If instances in private subnets still can’t reach the internet after deploying a NAT Gateway, the first things I’d check are: whether the private subnet’s route table points to the NAT Gateway, that the NAT Gateway is in a public subnet with an Internet Gateway attached, and that it has an Elastic IP. I’d also verify security group and NACL rules to ensure return traffic isn’t being blocked.



=================================================================================================================================================================================

10\) Your compliance requirement says that all traffic must pass through a firewall appliance before reaching the internet. How would you architect this in VPC?



To meet the compliance requirement, I’d deploy a firewall appliance in a dedicated subnet and configure the private subnet route tables so all outbound traffic is routed through the firewall first. The firewall would then forward approved traffic to a NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway. For scalability and high availability, I could use AWS Gateway Load Balancer in front of the firewall appliances. This ensures all internet-bound traffic is inspected, meeting compliance needs without exposing private instances directly.
